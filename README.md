1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saishshinde15/Langchain_RAG_BOT.git
   cd Langchain_RAG_BOT
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
